# Savings Module Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Savings Module is a full-stack application designed to manage savings goals and transactions with robust admin controls and data integrity features.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the server directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Core Features

### 1. Transaction Processing
- **Idempotency**: Implemented using unique idempotency keys for transactions
  - Required for all deposit and withdrawal requests
  - Prevents duplicate transactions even on network failures
  - Keys are stored in the Transaction model

### 2. Data Integrity
- **Reconciliation System**:
  - Balance verification between transactions and goals
  - Duplicate transaction detection
  - Transaction integrity checks (no negative balances)
  - Automated health checks via API endpoint

### 3. Admin Controls
- **Transaction Management**:
  - View all transactions
  - Approve/reject withdrawal requests
  - Transaction history with filtering
  - System health monitoring

- **Access Levels**:
  - Admin: Full access to all features
  - Manager: Can manage transactions
  - User: Basic features only

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login

### Transactions
- POST /api/transactions/deposit
- POST /api/transactions/withdrawal
- GET /api/transactions/ledger
- GET /api/transactions/ledger/all (admin)
- GET /api/transactions/withdrawals/pending (admin)
- PUT /api/transactions/withdrawal/:id (admin)

### Reconciliation
- GET /api/reconciliation/check (admin)

## Security Assumptions

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Refresh tokens not implemented (requires re-login)

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Middleware checks on all protected routes
   - Admin privileges verified per-request

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Input validation on all API endpoints
   - Amount validation for transactions
   - Balance checks before withdrawals

## Error Handling

1. **Transaction Failures**:
   - Failed transactions marked accordingly
   - Automatic rollback of incomplete transactions
   - Error logging and monitoring

2. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   - Idempotency keys required for all transactions
   - Unique constraint enforcement
   - Conflict resolution procedures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Health Checks**:
   - Automated balance reconciliation
   - Duplicate transaction detection
   - System integrity verification

2. **Administration**:
   - Admin dashboard for monitoring
   - Transaction approval workflow
   - User management interface

## Future Improvements

1. **Scalability**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add database indexing for better performance
   - Consider message queue for transaction processing

2. **Security**:
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add audit logging

3. **Features**:
   - Batch transaction processing
   - Enhanced reporting capabilities
   - Real-time notifications

## Support and Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Transaction Failures
   - Check idempotency key implementation
   - Verify database connection
   - Review transaction logs

2. Balance Discrepancies
   - Run reconciliation check
   - Review transaction history
   - Check for failed transactions

3. Admin Access Issues
   - Verify user role assignments
   - Check token expiration
   - Review middleware logs
